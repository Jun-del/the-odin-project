  <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
  <li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sauce:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 ½ tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
  <li>¾ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fried Quinoa:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
  <li>¼ onion, chopped</li>
  <li>3 scallions, chopped, divided</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
  <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
  <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan; season with salt. Reduce
    heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has
    been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let sit for 5
    minutes; fluff quinoa with a fork. Refrigerate until cool, 8 hours to
    overnight.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until sauce
    is evenly mixed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over high heat; saute carrots
    and onion for 2 minutes. Add 2 scallions, garlic, and ginger; saute until
    fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and
    quinoa; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir sauce into quinoa mixture; cook and stir until evenly coated, about 2
    minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make well in the center of the quinoa mixture. Pour eggs into the well; cook
    and stir until eggs are scrambled and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
    peas and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining scallion.
  </li>
</ol>
